# Bio Rocket Pressure Simulation

Welcome to the Bio Rocket's 2024 Pressure Simulation Python Program! This tool is designed to calculate and output critical performance parameters for our biofuel-powered rocket engine, with results saved to a `.CSV` file.

## Features:
- **Input:** The program accepts a JSON file containing key input parameters. Please ensure the JSON file follows the specified format.
- **Assumptions:** Calculations assume subsonic flow conditions (i.e., less than 0.3 Mach speed), ideal for accurate modeling under these specific conditions.
- **Output:** A `.CSV` file containing critical pressure data and other performance metrics is generated, allowing for further analysis and integration with other design tools.

## Usage:
1. Provide the input JSON file following the required structure.
2. Run the program.
3. Retrieve the results in the output `.CSV` file.
